## Rust Practice

The primary purpose of this repository is to practice Rust using Leetcode problems.

Any of the solutions can be tested by cloning the project and running:

```bash
cargo test <name_of_solutions_mod_>
```

So for module `add_two_numbers` you can run:
```bash
cargo test add_two_numbers
```
